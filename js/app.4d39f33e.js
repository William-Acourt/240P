This was mainly a new robot purely focused on shooting flags and flipping caps. We came to the conclusion that switching to flywheel was the best option due to the versatility of it, we hope you agree with us after seeing some of what we can do in this reveal :) . One of the major changes for this robot was switching to a far more powerful 8m drive to help us do what we love, constantly play hard defense on our opponents.\n\n High Quality competed at the 2019 VEX Robotics NZ National Championships, finishing in first place and winning the Tournament Champions and Design Awards.  \n### Specs:\n- 8m 5:3 Speed 3.25\" Drive\n- 2m 15:1 Speed Flywheel\n- 1m 1:1 Torque Cap Flipper\n- 1m 640RPM Intake\n\n<div class='embed'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/tEOX_e-BGyM' frameborder='0' allow='autoplay; encrypted-media' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>",tags:["VEX","Turning Point","Robots"]},{title:"Medium Quality",slug:"medium-quality",subtitle:"Our second robot for the 2018-2019 VEX season",body:"![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/285485052035334154/724030950668763226/IMG_5965.jpg?width=1406&height=937 'Medium Quality Robot')\nFor our second Turning Point robot, we decided to focus on quickly and effectively scoring flags due to the high score potential with this strategy. We moved away from scoring caps on poles as the points gained simply aren't worth it considering the time taken to score, and how easy it is to descore. We learned a lot through this robot by testing multiple different launcher designs throughout the lifespan of Medium Quality. The later robots built by our team were greatly influenced by everything we learnt from this robot, especially since it was our first attempt at a flag scoring robot.\n\n Medium Quality competed at the 2018 World Skills NZ National Championships in Hamilton where we finished with the gold medal in the Mobile Robotics Category. \n### Specs:\n- 6m 1:1 Turbo 4\" Bling Drive\n- 2m 1:7 Speed Catapult\n- 1m 1:1 Torque Cap Flipper\n- 1m 3:1 Speed Intake\n\n<div class='embed'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/VtBIXOg0EsI' frameborder='0' allow='autoplay; encrypted-media' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>",tags:["VEX","Turning Point","Robots"]},{title:"Low Quality",slug:"low-quality",subtitle:"Our first robot for the 2018-2019 VEX season",body:"![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/317204421526421514/465106499103096832/thumbnail.png 'Low Quality LCD')\nThis was the first robot our team had ever built together.

It was built for the 2018 Combat Robotics Nationals during a time where we probably should have been working on VEX instead. After building Doorstop we wanted to try building a combat robot with an active weapon rather than the simple wedge design of Doorstop. Snow White was originally planned to be a drum spinner, but we were quickly running out of time and manufacturing a drum would have been very difficult to do in the time we had. So we decided to just go for a simple horizontal spinner. The blade for this horizontal spinner was very simple, we just found a steel brushcutter blade at a hardware store and used that. This was belt driven by a brushless motor and all of that was bolted to a titanium base plate with HDPE side and back armour. All of this was built over only a few days, so we didn’t really have high hopes for how well it would perform.\n\n### The CAD design for Snow White\n\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/285485052035334154/534691154596462602/5amCmOLuisaFi59LjpIqyssiCRTkeWsZvMAVNLbFHWdxGQP9bx9tUVOdXUlR29frzWPI5Mfxlq_5TOE6Ita51OZ0jHWCI-l8LYo6.png 'Snow White Render')We didn’t do too great in the competition (unsurprisingly), we had some unexceptional wins and some pretty impressive losses. One of our main issues was traction, due to how heavy we were at the front (due to the weapon) there was very little force pressing the back wheels into the ground. As we used foam wheels this meant that they had very little grip, so the robot was very difficult to control. This made driving extremely difficult as the robot would coast around the arena, so it was very difficult to avoid hitting the arena walls. This was especially a problem since our robot was a horizontal spinner, which made hitting the arena walls with our weapon very easy. This just meant we couldn’t drive precisely, which was one of the main reasons we did so well with our last combat robot Doorstop. With this and our weapon's unreliability we never really performed very well in matches, and in our last match in the upper elimination bracket we were basically completely destroyed by our opponent, leaving us with a broken weapon bar, a damaged LiPo, and no replacements.\n\n#### The last match of Snow White...\n\n<div class='embed'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/eMPulFDPUpY?start=333' frameborder='0' allow='autoplay; encrypted-media' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nBecause of this slight problem we ended up bringing back Doorstop for one final match. We had to take all of the electronics, drive motors, and wheels from Snow White and put them into doorstop before our next match. What we ended up with was a version of Doorstop with brushless drive motors, and completely different electronics.\n\n#### A picture partway through the surgery\n\n![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/285485052035334154/534684532075397120/BwAPLrGO2Y3XmA-PZ4jUxfhx9Nu_HcZ0_0spjcaeQChKJKoBwvAZvbQjlzWaB0xj5gEg0hFc2RdUsxpoZk_cCf0L_3ARXds8g8BG.png?width=1143&height=1253 'Snow White Surgery')\n\nHowever, we did have a small problem that we didn’t have a working LiPo battery for our robot. We ended up having to buy a LiPo from a nearby hobby store stand. Unfortunately they only had 4S (14.8V) LiPos whereas we had designed our robot around using 3S (11.1V) batteries. However, all our electronics and motors were rated for the higher voltage so we decided to go for it anyway. The main issue with this was that Doorstop became uncontrollably fast. Even still we had a fun final match that ended up with Doorstop horribly disfigured in a barely functional state. With this final match we were knocked out of the competition.\n\n<div class='embed'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/7odX13G3mZo' frameborder='0' allow='autoplay; encrypted-media' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nAlthough we didn’t do that well, it was still a very fun experience. Hopefully next time we can actually devote some proper time to build a far more robust combat robot next time.",tags:["Combat Robotics","Beetleweight","Robots"]},{title:"Doorstop",slug:"doorstop",subtitle:"Can't stop, won't stop, keeping it DOORSTOP",body:"![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/285485052035334154/493614998262906900/hg6CGef7t2fQeZ_b7MAiDj9_kUK_qSWZnM0KpTJ5qs8GvhRmMbJrPfhY7z7wjyfKhtrqG7ekitvMwzmVwFhuqwGFsc71VOMQ0P0R.png 'Doorstop')Doorstop was our first attempt at building a robot outside of VEX, and our first attempt at building a combat robot. Doorstop was built in the beetleweight category for combat robots, which is for robots below 1.37kgs. As this was our first attempt for anything like this we built a simple wedgebot. It comprised of a steel base and steel wedge with aluminum angle used for the sides and a polycarbonate cover for the top. Doorstop was powered with a 2 wheel brushed drive. The original version of Doorstop actually had a servo motor to lift the wedge as a poor attempt at a flipper. This really didn’t work well, so it was removed after our first match and the wedge was just held down statically by zipties instead. Through some magic we actually did pretty well with Doorstop at our first competition, we ended up losing in finals and taking home the second place trophy.<div class='embed'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8YfsVjocByA' frameborder='0' allow='autoplay; encrypted-media' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>\n\n",tags:["Combat Robotics","Beetleweight","Robots"]},{title:"Design Notebook Tips",subtitle:"How to not suck at Notebooks",slug:"notebooks",body:"There are several key principles to remember when writing a design notebook entry. Firstly, you must make sure that you cover everything you did on any particular day, whether that be discussion of how you did at a recent scrimmage, or your thoughts on a new design you’re considering. Talk about all of the different ideas your team came up with in order to solve a certain problem, such as how to grasp a gap or shoot a ball – as best you can you should compare these ideas, using pros/cons tables, and logically working through why one design is superior to another. It’s also important to quantifiably argue as best you can, if you can say one design is twice as fast as another, do that! If you can mathematically work out that one lift design will move 32% as fast as another, do that! Quantifying why you believe something is highly important in VEX robotics, and engineering as a whole – and as bonus you’ll begin to learn some very applicable trigonometry and physics.\n\nSecondly, it’s important to make sure that your engineering notebooks are clear and easy to understand. Where possible use simple language that a 12-year-old could understand, try to avoid using terminology before explaining it (i.e. RD4B, drive train, etc) – remember judges might not have experience with VEX. Attaching a glossary at the start of your notebook can be a very good way to circumvent this issue. Whenever you’re trying to explain a complicated mechanism, diagrams and labelled pictures are your best bet, like the one I’ve attached below (which I made in powerpoint!). They should be easy enough for a layman to understand, while still showing the concept of the design in a clear and concise manner. Color coding things makes it easy for judges to understand what you’re talking about by looking at your diagram.\n\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/285485052035334154/534566837074001930/unknown.png 'diagram')\n\nThirdly, show contributions from all of your team members, both in the writing of the engineering notebook and in the work on the robot. Judges like to see that the team functions as a team, colour coding and organising your engineering notebook in a way that makes logical sense and shows contributions from all team members is the best way to do this.\n\nFourthly, make sure you have enough detail in your notebooks. You should be able to look at your notebooks and easily see what previous designs you considered and tried out, and why they didn’t work. This should help to influence your current design decisions, allowing you to ultimately make a better robot moving forward. If you so chose to, by looking at your pictures and documentation you should be able to rebuild any mechanism on your robot. From replicating a complicated flywheel gearbox to a simple arm. This usually means it’s always a good idea to take photographs of spacing and bracing, to allow for easier hole-counting later on.\n\nFifthly, make sure to have solid competition recaps in your notebook – this is one that I see many teams failing to do. You should critically analyse where your team fell short in a scrimmage. Who forgot to put batteries in the robot, was your coach not being clear enough to the driver, did the driver not have enough practice on the robot, did someone forget to charge batteries or change number plates. Holding people responsible and talking about how you’re addressing issues in a team context is an excellent thing to contain in your design notebooks.\n\nFinally, it’s a good idea to try and get feedback from judges throughout the season – see how you’re tracking in your notebook writing process. Comparing your notebook to the rubric and being overly critical of your work and your process can also be an excellent idea to confirm that your design notebook is up to where you want it to be. If you have to, directly look to “one up” other teams in your region.\n\nHopefully these tips on how to write a good design notebook have been useful, remember team 240p is always happy to address questions or concerns you might have about design notebooks or anything else.
